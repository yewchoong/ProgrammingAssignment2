## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it 
## repeatedly. Write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
 
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse 
## from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getInverse()
  if (!is.null(i)) {
    message('retrieve the inverse from the cache')
  } else {
    ## message('calculate the inverse')
    i <- solve(x$get())
    ## update new inverse to x
    x$setInverse(i)
  }
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i
}
